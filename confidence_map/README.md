Compute an ultrasound confidence map for each 2D frame using MONAI’s UltrasoundConfidenceMapTransform, which implements the random-walks approach of Karamalis et al. (MedIA 2012). For each frame, we provide an input array of shape [1, H, W] (single channel), and the transform returns a confidence map of the same spatial size, where each pixel encodes the probability that a random walk starting at that pixel reaches the source (high confidence) before reaching any sink (low confidence). Internally, MONAI builds a weighted pixel graph, forms a sparse Laplacian, and solves a linear system to obtain these probabilities; the parameters α, β, γ control the edge weighting/smoothness and sensitivity to intensity transitions, while sink_mode defines how sink locations are chosen.
Our raw frames are stored as (H, W) = (512, 128) and are normalized to [0, 1] prior to processing. We observed that MONAI’s default sink/source heuristics can become degenerate for very narrow images, producing a constant confidence map. To avoid this, we pad each frame laterally to 512×512, compute the confidence map on the padded image, and then crop back to the original width (512×128) before saving. For correct visualization and overlay in ImFusion, we store the output together with matching metadata (confidence_spacing, confidence_shiftScale) so that the confidence map is rendered with the same physical spacing as the original ultrasound frames.
1. Inside ImFusion export your acquired US frames as .h5 file
2. rename the file as input.h5, for example
3. run 
  ```
  cd /home/chiara_piemontese/iiwa_stack_ws/src/confidence_map/monai
  python3 confidence_map_monai.py
  ```

4. obtain the confidence volume.mha inside ImFusion.
   
  - Import the output.h5 inside imfusion
  - click both the .h5 file and the tracking sequence (exracted from the US sweep)
  - Ultrasound > Convert to sweep
  - then click Ultrasound > Sweep compounding --> you obtain the volume
